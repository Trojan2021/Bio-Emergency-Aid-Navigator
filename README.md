# Bio-Emergency-Aid-Navigator
For MakeOHI/O 2024, The Cool Beans created the Bio-Emergency-Aid-Navigator (BEAN). The Bean is designed to identify potentially injured and/or lost individuals and deliver them first-aid materials. A specific example would be identifying people in forest fire rescues. In the current stage of the project, we’re using a DJI Mavic Mini drone with YOLOv8 to showcase our proof of concept. On the DJI Mavic Mini, we’ve created our own drop system that utilizes 3D printed parts, an Adafruit ESP32, and a servo to simulate the dropping of first-aid materials. YOLOv8 has a lot of different models for different scenarios depending on desired accuracy/speed so for our project we decided to use YOLOv8-S. We’ve trained the YOLOv8-S model with footage we took on the drone during the Makeathon. Also, we’re providing a dashboard interface to display necessary information and interact with certain features of the drone. The code for this project is completely written and maintained in Python.

In the future, we’d like to expand upon our project to the next stage to provide more and/or heavier supplies to be delivered by using better drones, better materials, and a better drop system. Also, with more time we’d like to fine-tune our models to better detect injured and/or lost individuals more accurately. We’re hoping with our project, it helps push the concept even further with new uses and for cheaper.
